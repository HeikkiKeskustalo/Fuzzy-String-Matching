As to the documentation of the snowball stemmer (https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/snowball.html), 
there is no the remove of Finnish punctuation (remove the space, or dash or enter) to fit our Ilari's data, 
the adding of Space package on remove punc, lemma could be considered (https://spacy.io/usage/#section-instructions). 
Therefore, the planning stage of mining could be:
 
1, remove punc, remove lemma, stopwords
2, dash issue
3, detect charset 
4, decode
5, tokenize
6, snowball stemmer
